### ORCID Share My ID

https://share-my-id.orcid.org/

In order to facilitate USC's need to collect ORCID identifiers from researchers it is proposed that ORCID's SHARE MY ORCID ID functionality be utilised.

The method is quite simple:
- Create a new ID collection using your own ORCID iD
- Use the Share link to request iDs by email or on a webpage
- Visit the Share link to view and download the iDs you've collected.

If a user doesn't have an iD they can register for one and add it to the collection at the same time.
